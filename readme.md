# Project Gainsboro

...Yeah, that's pretty much all we know about the project.

This project has some unlisted objectives for now, yet it really serves as a true first foray into an x86 Assembly project for me (Robert). While I've worked in it before, I've never actually put together a full-on project. This honestly could turn into anything at this point...so stay tuned!
